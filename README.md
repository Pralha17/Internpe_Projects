# 📌 **InternPe Java Projects**  

Welcome to the **InternPe Java Projects** repository! This repository contains Java-based projects assigned to me during my internship at InternPe. Each project showcases my understanding of **Java programming, object-oriented principles, and problem-solving skills**, along with my **technical presentation and assessment performance**.  

## 🚀 **Internship Tasks & Projects**  

1. **🎮 Connect 4**  
   - Implemented the classic Connect 4 game using Java.  
   - Features: Player vs. Player mode, board visualization, and win detection logic.  

2. **✊🖐✌ Rock Paper Scissors**  
   - Created a console-based Rock Paper Scissors game in Java.  
   - Features: Randomized AI opponent, user input validation, and score tracking.  

3. **🎰 Number Guessing Game**  
   - A fun and interactive game where users guess a randomly generated number.  
   - Features: Multiple difficulty levels, attempt tracking, and hints for better engagement.  

4. **❌⭕ Tic-Tac-Toe**  
   - Developed a Java-based Tic-Tac-Toe game with an interactive console interface.  
   - Features: Player vs. Player mode, automatic win-checking, and game restart functionality.  

## 🛠️ **Tech Stack Used**  
- **Programming Language:** Java ☕  
- **Core Concepts:** OOP, Exception Handling, Collections, Recursion  
- **Tools & IDEs:** IntelliJ IDEA / Eclipse / VS Code  
- **Development Approach:** Test-driven development, modular programming, and algorithm optimization  

## 🎯 **My Unique Contributions**  
✅ Designed **clean and efficient algorithms** for game logic and user interactions.  
✅ Applied **object-oriented programming principles** (encapsulation, abstraction, polymorphism) for maintainable code.  
✅ Implemented **error handling** and **input validation** to improve user experience.  
✅ Used **collections framework** for optimized data management in game logic.  

## 🏆 **Internship Assessment Criteria**  
🔹 **Java Technical Skills** – Evaluated based on coding efficiency, problem-solving, and project implementation.  
🔹 **Unique Contributions** – Creativity in logic implementation, code efficiency, and modularization.  
🔹 **Presentation Skills** – Ability to explain project architecture, logic, and real-world applicability.  
🔹 **Technical Assessment** – Hands-on assessment based on Java concepts, debugging, and code optimization.  

## 🔧 **Setup & Usage**  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Pralha17/Internpe_Projects.git
   cd Internpe_Projects
   ```
2. Open the project in an IDE (Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, or VS Code).  
3. Compile and run the Java files using:
